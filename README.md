The choreography
- DMS Majors will have their own section to talk about why they chose DMS

Designer's notes:
The designer has implemented the z-pattern on homepage by placing the title to the top-left, the first navigation to the top-right and the second navigation to the bottom-right part of the page, and the required visual focus is given to them among other content like team roles section which is on the bottom-left side of the homepage. 
The sub-page was implemented with f-pattern, on that page the images are positioned on the left side, whereas, the text is posioned on the right side.
